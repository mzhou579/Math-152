What proportion of numbers are prime, and how does this proportion change over different ranges?  As theoretical questions, these belong the the field of analytic number theory.  But it is hard to know what to prove without doing a bit of experimentation.

        "1.  Create functions `redprimes_upto(x)` and `blueprimes_upto(x)` which count the number of red/blue primes up to a given number `x`.  Recall that we defined red/blue primes to be those of the form 4n+1 or 4n+3, respectively.  Graph the relative proportion of red/blue primes as `x` varies from 1 to 1 million.  E.g., are the proportions 50%/50% or 70%/30%, and how do these proportions change?  Note:  this is also visualized in [An Illustrated Theory of Numbers](http://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-105) and you can read [an article by Rubinstein and Sarnak](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.em/1048515870) for more.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Does there seem to be a bias in the last digits of primes?  Note that, except for 2 and 5, every prime ends in 1,3,7, or 9.  Note: the last digit of a number `n` is obtained from `n % 10`.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Read about the [\"Prime Conspiracy\"](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-discover-prime-conspiracy-20160313), recently discovered by Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan.  Can you detect their conspiracy in our data set of primes?"
